    This past weekend I had the pleasure of participating in <a href="http://www.waterloohacks.io">Waterloo hacks</a>. It boasted an impressive list of sponsors including Manulife, OpenText, SAP and Google. (They didn't disappoint in the swag department either!)
</p>

<p>
    This was my first hackathon, and it made me wish I had done more throughout University. Unfortunately I seemed to be too preoccupied in my younger days with partying just down the road at WLU. 
</p>
<p>
    Nonetheless, I spent about 40 of the allotted 48 hours conscious and at my macbook hammering away at our <em>hack</em>. While some sponsors offered some guidance on what your hack should entail, in order to qualify for their prize, there was <strong>absolutely no guidance</strong> otherwise. What a concept. Here's all the food, resources and talent you could ever need, now do <strong>whatever it is that you'd like!</strong>. 
</p>
<p>
    My team landed on an iOS app, that allowed users to log moment in their life with nothing more than a picture, a quick optional note and a ranking of their happiness. A virtual journal if you will. The app will then pull data at the time of the photo such as the weather, the billboard charts and the stock market performance and allow the user to re-live that particular snapshot in their travels. The name? <em>Rearview</em>.
</p>
<p>
    The idea was that if you are constantly keeping an unbiased log of your mental state, you could begin to correlate things in your life that affect your mood for better or for worse.
</p>
<p>
    To achieve this, we landed on using React Native, and Django on the server side. We were all excited to explore the hype around Facebook's new mobile technology, and what better way to do so. Here is how it turned out:
</p>
<div class="slider">
    <ul>
        <li><img src="/images/rearview/1.jpg" style="height: 400px;"/></li>
        <li><img src="/images/rearview/2.jpg" style="height: 400px;"/></li>
        <li><img src="/images/rearview/3.jpg" style="height: 400px;"/></li>
        <li><img src="/images/rearview/4.jpg" style="height: 400px;"/></li>
        <li><img src="/images/rearview/5.jpg" style="height: 400px;"/></li>
        <li><img src="/images/rearview/6.jpg" style="height: 400px;"/></li>
        <li><img src="/images/rearview/7.jpg" style="height: 400px;"/></li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p>
    I felt we had a strong product, however we weren't one of the 10 teams invited to pitch our product in the finals. While I'm certainly biased, I felt the contest was more about ambitious innovations and less about execution of a working hack.
</p>
<p>
    Despite the short-falling, I'm proud of what our small team was able to accomplish. None of us had even so much as opened Xcode before, yet here was a fully functional iOS app out the door in a mere 48 hours. I suppose the real prize was not the $750 in tech gadgets of the winning teams' choosing, but rather the skills you'll pad onto your resume.
