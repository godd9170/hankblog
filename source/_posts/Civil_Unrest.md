Today was a first. I found myself mixed into an enormous protest in the streets of Bucharest Romania. What I thought at first was to be a vigil for the fallen of a recent tragedy, turned out to be the culmination of years of political friction.

Let me explain the situation as I understand it from having been here for just over a week (apologies to any Romanian readers if I'm off). On October 20th, a policeman clearing the road for Romania's Interior Minister, Gabriel Oprea's motorcade, was killed when his speeding bike hit a pothole. Citizens are already upset with some of the inherent corruption that exists within the standing government, their overuse of motorcades just one of the examples. The people demanded Oprea step down, and not only did he ignore them, he refused to comment on the policeman's death, and said he wasn't even aware of the man's death 6 days after. Not a good dude.

Fast forward to last Friday (the 30th of October), and tragedy strikes _Club Colectiv_. A fire caused by pyrotechnic effect sparks ignited the foam soundproofing that covered the walls. _Colectiv_ was a retro-fit decomishioned shoe factory packed with 400 people enjoying the launch of local band _Goodbye to Gravity_'s new album. With only one exit, panic ensued killing 31 and severly injuring as much as 180. 

This could not have come at a worse time. Over the weekend, the people's sadness grew to anger. Now tonight the 3rd of November I find myself watching people marching sidewalk to side walk through the streets chanting for the resignition of Mr. Oprea.

Hailing from a rural portion of Canada, I've been sheltered from comparable demonstrations at home. Civil unrest such as the riots following the Vancouver Stanley Cup loss of 2011, or the 2012 Quebec student protests for example happened far from peaceful Prince Edward County. In a strictly educational way, I wish I were present during them in order to have some baseline by which to compare what I've experienced here. 

I could feel the ground shaking from the rythmic hopping accompanying cries of resignation. Their syncronized roars of distaste reverberating between the grand stone buildings common to Bucharest's core. While I was unable to understand the language being used, it was almost not neccesary as the tone that carried it spoke enough. Apart from some minor pushing where the police barrier met the crowd, no violence was shown.
