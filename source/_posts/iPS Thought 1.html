  I've got a weird habit of writing iPhone notes containing ideas that pop into my head. Not so much ideas as they are interesting thoughts, typically brought on by the influence of social consumption. Every so often a completely 'organic' tidbit gets recorded, but there is definitely something about a few beers that can really bring on the creativity.
</p>
<p>
  Perhaps I'm alone, but oftentimes a wave of clarity consumes my thoughts, and the only thing I focus on is constructing a sentence or two that perfectly encapsulates the thesis of my brief dance with enlightenment. I think the only reason I do it, is because I feel some closure knowing that the idea produced during these rare moments can be revisited later.
</p>
<p>
  The notes vary from attempts at profoundness, to business ventures, to indecipherable pointless jabber. Nonetheless I thought it would be fun to explore one each Sunday. And so, I present to you, noble audience of what I presume to be three or four; <strong>'iPhone Note Sundays'</strong>.

      "Not worrying about tailoring your behaviour (within reason) so not to offend anyone around you, is arguably the best part of hanging out with your friends."

  Finding myself at more social business events, I've learned it's actually rather tiring maintaining an appropriate level of engagement in topics that aren't necessarily of interest. Furthermore consciously 'tailoring you behaviour' definitely takes away from the enjoyment that boundaryless conversation has.
</p>
<p>
 To go a layer deeper, one could even argue that more beneficial topics are addressed, and more creative solutions generated when there isn't an overarching fear of offending the other party. When you're comfortable that the â€˜discussee' knows you and your morals, and that a bold statement made by yourself won't shape how they view you as a whole, it makes for much more mutually beneficial dialogue.
