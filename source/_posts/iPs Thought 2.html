  This Sunday's <strong>iPhone Thought</strong>'s exact place of origin has unfortunately been lost. Likely due to the topic it is discussing. It is yet another product of 1am, which seems to be a pretty common time for these.

      "If you did it properly, you'll never remember how many beers you drank"

  On the surface, that seems like a frat inspired, keg standing, go-hard comment, and it likely is, but I'm going to take a run at deriving some more meaning from it. Perhaps this is a metaphor for experiences in general. Swap 'beers you drank' with 'new experiences you've had' and we've got ourselves a anecdote worth sharing. Overwhelm yourself with positivity, and soon your life will become so filled with hapiness, that you can't put a number to the joyous occasions.
