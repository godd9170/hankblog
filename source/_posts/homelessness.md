The 'Lowest Vacancy Rates Toronto has seen in years' has put me in a rather precarious spot. My sublet ended August 31st, and there exists no lodging for myself thus far, here on the 5th of September. I swear it's not for a lack of trying as I began my hunt for accommodations back in July, albeit not as tenaciously as these last few days. 

I've managed to get myself subscribed to a number of channels that promise a comprehensive listing of all places, Padmapper, Kijiji, Craigslist, Zumper, Realtor.ca, Condos.ca and with the help of some agents - MLS. I send about 10 emails a day, that were once a hopeful synopsis of myself, and a request to view, and now consist of an semi-defeated inquiry as to the vacancy of the unit. It seems I can't just charm myself into housing, the 60% 'Sorry property has been leased' rate has beaten the humility out of me.

While I've not an exact figure, I have seen roughly 25 places in the last 15 days, sometimes meeting a realtor friend, sometimes a landlord, and occasionally a non-existant, no-response, waste of your time no-show. The viewings are typically single digit hours after listing, and precede themselves with the phrase 'Several offers have already been made'. Plenty of times offers are made without even looking at the unit! My partner in crime, and prospective roommate Joe and I have learned not to feel any sort of excitement post viewing, as the odds are we'll not even have the chance to submit an offer. 

We once got as far as being conditionally accepted on an offer, meaning a deposit, first and last month's rent and we would receive the keys. However this was back in the naive early days of September where we thought we could do better and pulled the plug on the deal. There have been some regrets since then.

There was another time, with 10 days remaining in August that we'd thought we found a deal too good to be true. $2200/mo for an 800ft^2 unit on Fort York road with 2 bathrooms and a parking spot. We were even more delighted to learn that only one other offer had been submitted. We even heard back from the landlord who was very interested in meeting us - so we obliged. Then came the kicker - A Tennant who still resided in the unit had been neglecting to pay rent for 5 months now and would not vacate. "However", our potential landlord quipped, "We have a court date this Thursday and we're sure we can get her to leave." Well, that sounds like a pretty minor issue. Surely a void of a tenancy agreement such as FAILING TO PAY THE RENT FOR 5 MONTHS, would be easy to enforce. Well, as we learned the following Friday - no, no it isn't. Justice doesn't exist, and Joe and I are now viewing 5 living spaces daily batting the prospective renters who are also in a state of desperation.

I've managed to secure myself a bed at my previous sublet from a roommate who is out of town for the week, and come Friday I'll lay my sheets down on a couch. There is a tremendous weight on me these days, and I yearn for the days where a long day at the office could be rounded off with a flop on a couch at an abode I call home. Until then, chin up I suppose - for I've got some emails to send.
