  It's been a while since I've revealed the contents of my iPhone notepad to the world, but alas here is yet another textual glimpse inside my brain. This one comes from a cab ride I took with some friends to a housewarming party at a new apartment in Bucharest.

I quite enjoy the banter that invariably evokes itself between cab drivers (and uber drivers for that matter) and cab clientele. It's as though the your friend group, who typically share a relatively common ideology now have a temporary external viewpoint drop in. A common topic, Politics.

      "Taxi cab political conversations are the more elaborate."

 Bucharest is undergoing a time of significant political change, and seems to be the topic of most people's conversations. While I couldn't understand what the man behind the wheel was saying, it was clear that all parties involved spoke with passion. It reminded me of plenty of cases I'd found myself in various Ubers and cabs over the last few years. Being that I was merely and observer in this exchange, I was able to jot down my micro-epiphany.

  I suppose I'm not the first to recognize the escalation of driver-passenger commentary, HBO released <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114639/">Taxi-Cab Confessions</a> in 1995, which highlighted this exact feat. There is something about the scenario, that makes it unlike other any other dialogue with strangers. Perhaps it's the mutual understanding that prolonged silence is more painful than some chatter, perhaps it's the lack of eye contact should you be seated immediately behind the operator. I don't know, but I do know that I love me some good taxi-cab discourse.

 If not politics, sometimes topics of great empathy can emerge. I had a rather teary eyed ride on my way to the Seattle-Tacoma airport with a man who lost his mother due to brain cancer. We had a very common experience and it took us from strangers to pseudo brothers over the duration of the 20 minute journey. While full of pain, there was something really satisfying about the experience. It was as though I wanted a ride, and got a therapy session. Forget <a href="http://ubereats.com/">UberEats</a> try <strong>UberFreuds</strong>.

  I suppose the therapy of speaking candidly to a stranger is a two-way street. I read a tweet from a New Yorker who had a bit of a reversed experience, where he offered some solidarity to a victim of islamaphobia in the wake of Friday's events.

 I guess if there is anything to take from this, next time you need some human interaction, a second opinion on something or a just a shoulder to cry on - hop in a cab.
