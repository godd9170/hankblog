I never understood surfing. I'm not dismissing it, I never claimed it to be an easy art, nor do I think it's not appealing, I'm merely saying I truly didn't understand it. I'd put some time in on a wakeboard in the past, and I suppose I assumed it to be a similar sensation. I was quite wrong.

Was a fine May sunday on the Oregon coast where I procured a wetsuit and a sturdy 8ft board from a quaint little surf shop. Flash forward an hour and I find myself straddling my new aquatic wave platform roughly 30ft from shore bobbing up and down in shoulder height rollers.
I took lead from my longtime friend who had recently caught the surfing bug and hence my enrolment in the Sunday activity. He yelled over the crashes of water on water, briefing me on the paddling technique required to attach oneself to a beachgoing sea vibration. "Lay stomach down towards the beach, paddle hard, when a wave comes, paddle harder, and when you're in the wave paddle even harder." With no intentions of letting him down I did just that. Then it happened.
A few previous attempts had me fall behind the wave, but not this time. I was consumed, and my pace matched that of my new fluid transport. Almost like an adopted child, I had been accepted. An immediate realization came flooding in. I get it. Surfing is about harnessing nature, latching onto the tremendous energy of the ocean and caring about that and only that, for a few exhilerating moments. 
Yeah sure I didn't actually quite stand up, but I felt it. I've still much to learn, and I look forward to my next oceanic encounter.
