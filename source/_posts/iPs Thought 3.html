  Perhaps more profound that iPhone Notes past, today's quote attempts to generalize all actions of humans in general.

      "Everyone's actions are driven by the pursuit of the next state of mental comfort."

  True selflessness is a very rare trait. What does one gain from going out of their way to help another? An intrinsic sense of fufilment is what at least I'm after when I do things that only benefit others, and there in lies the crux of this thought. While I'm not privy to anything tangible as a result of selflessness, the satisfaction I receive is payment. The mental comfort conjured by such actions can be equated to real world objects, gestures or actions.

  So to re-visit the thought, mental comfort is what drives everyone. Mental comfort through money earned, family cared for, or even urges sated. A human's actions can be digressed back to mending the current lull in mental comfort.
