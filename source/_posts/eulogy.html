I was hesitant to post this, however I decided that despite the overbearing grief it fostered, it was one of the prouder moments in my life. The speech was a bit different than this, as I had worked from bullet points the day of. Below you'll find my best attempt at re-constructing what was actually delivered.

I think a father's greatest duty, is to pass along the wisdom he's collected through life to his offspring. I also think that wisdom is a little more applicable to Sons rather than daughters, and fortunately for Jeffy, He's got 2. So I'd like to take this opportunity to share what I've learned from the old man and I hope everyone here can derive some benefit from it.
</p>

Here we go:

<ol>
  <li> "Eat until you are no longer hungry, not until you are full." </br>
    He would usually follow that up with: </br>
    "I've never been able to do it, but that's my advice"
  </li>

  <li>"Brussel sprouts are good and good for ya"</li>

  <li>"Eat your porridge it'll stick to your ribs"</li>

  <li>"Before you date a girl, make sure you meet her mother"</li>

  <li>"There are only 2 things that smell like fish, and one of them is fish"</li>
</ol>

<p>
However the best piece of advice, was never communicated to me via some cheeky one liner, but rather just an observation I've made being around my father. To keep my theme of singled sentenced wisdom doses going I've taken a stab at condesing it. And there is certainly a more elegant phrasing of this last piece, but it essentially all boils down to 'Just give a shit'. 
</p>

<p>
'Just give a shit', in every daily encounter you find yourself in, allow yourself to offer a minute piece of interest in someone else's life. People really resonate well when spoken to with some enthusiam and general regard for their current pursuits.
</p>

<p>
'Just giving a shit', is how you procure the boat load of dedicated lifelong friends Dad has all over the planet. Friendship was something extremely important to Jeff and he had a knack for recognizing strong character in people. It's a common theme for these folks, now couples, from out of town to spend the weekend at our house. Not one of these guests has ever  Establishing a mutual repect, and long term repor with people who would have otherwise never been associated had it not been for that initial outgoing nature and genuine kindness.

I didn't think it was possible to properly put a label on the type of person my father was. It didn't seem possible that one word could encapsulate the legacy. However I was able to find a definition that came pretty close:
</p>

<p>
/men(t)SH/
  <em>
  "someone to admire and emulate, someone of noble character. The key to being 'a real mensch' is nothing less than character, rectitude, dignity, a sense of what is right, responsible, decorous."
  </em>
</p>

<p>
I will dearly miss my father, and it is my hope that I one day become half the Mensch he was.
