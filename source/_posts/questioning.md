Try and think of the last really good conversation you had. What was it about that conversation that stood out? Was it a balance of speaking time from all involved parties, or did one member, perhaps yourself, do the bulk of the speaking? Was there a moment during the conversation that had you silently remarking how enjoyable it had been? Perhaps a moment where all parties agreed out loud that it was a strong exchange of words?

This is something I found myself musing about the other day after a chat with my colleague. He comes from the world of Sales, and has collected what he likes to call, "An array of Jedi mind tricks" throughout the years. His opinion, is that the strongest of conversationalists, have mastered the _Art of the Question_. Phrasing what you're trying to convey to someone, in the form of a question allows them to discover your point from their perspective - that is of course, if its done properly. It almost gives you the questioner, a viewport into the cognition of the answering party and allows for a control over the engagement in a way that prepositions simply cannot. 

I'm one to ramble. I used to try and answer my own questions as I was asking them, and enter a rabbit-hole of misguided self-banter until I received some form of acknowledgement from whoever was witnessing my monologue. I thought that to really 'win' a conversation was to provide the most best answers, as if somehow I'm to know what a person wants to hear without... well asking them.

For the last few weeks I've flipped the script. I now try to craft better, open ended questions that allow myself and whoever I'm talking to, to stay on track. The results have been rewarding. I find a lessened anxiety that I was accustomed to feeling whilst hunting for a statement during lulls in speaking. I find that my questions are more apt to push the conversation along. Most of all I find that the body language of my encounters tends to be more positive, and by that I mean I'm getting more agreement, and interest in what it is I'm saying.

So there it is, _The Art of the Question_. I was confused when it was first proposed to me, but I now truly regard it as one of the best business lessons I've had.
