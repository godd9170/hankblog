My Romanian compadres, Iulius and Bogdan had planned for my first weekend as a road trip north. After a Friday night of heavy drinking, we departed Bucharest into the Romanian countryside running on 4 hours of sleep and strong hangovers. The periodic sight of witches hats and other various costume reminded me that it was indeed Halloween. I'm told the celebration of Halloween is rather new in Europe, and costumes seem to be much less elobroate than that of 'go-hard' Western norms.

Perhpas it's appropriate then, that our first stop on the journey was non other than Dracula's castle. 'Castle Bran' as they insisted on calling it despite my objection, is quite the sight. It's converted into a museum that offers a slew of inforation both on the history of the Castle and the origins of Bram Stoker's novel. Non of this I read, as I was too busy trying to craft witty Snapchats and insisting to my co-travellers that dracula still resided here. Key takeaway? Iulius is actually Vlad the Impaler's, the Ruler whom Dracula is believed to be bsed on, great-great-great-grandson.
