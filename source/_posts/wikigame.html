    Have you ever had a long conversation with no general purpose, eventually reaching a topic that has everyone questioning, "How the hell did we start talking about this?" The discussion began with last night's party and ended up on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_modern_European_cuisine">Early modern European cuisine</a>? Then everyone tries to retrace their verbal steps back to the original dialogue?
</p>
<p>
    Perhaps you've spent far too long on Wikipedia recursively clicking links and reading articles in order to properly understand the previous article. It really is amazing how what seems to be two completely separate ideas are in fact related in one or two degrees of common topics. 
</p>
<p> 
    What's that? You've haven't experienced either of these scenarios? Well that's alright because this post thus far has just been a philosophical segway into this anyways:
</p>
    <div class="wiki-button-container">
        <a class="wiki-button" href="http://wiki.henrygoddard.com">The Wiki-Game</a>
        <div style="font-size: 10px;color: #4a4a4a;">(This only works on a computer, sorry mobile friends)</div>
    </div>

<p>
    That button will take you to a little app I whipped up that simulates what I was alluding to above. So you can experience what I was talking about without the need for friends! 
</p>
<p>
    So here's the deal. You get two completely unrelated Wikipedia article topics. You are then presented with all the links that can be found in the first article. When you click a link, you'll be brought all of that page's links. It's your job to strategically select links until you've reached the second article. You can hover your mouse over the title of the second article to get a brief summary of it so you're not completely in the dark. 
</p>
<p>
    You'll be greeted by a loading screen that cycles through the random Wikipedia topics. It's looking for a desitination article with a minimum of 300 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlink">backlinks</a>. I know I began this post talking about the magical interconnectivity of human knowledge, and how everything eventually relates to something else... but sometimes the topic is so goddamn obscure you haven't a hope in hell of finding it. So, sit tight and wait for a 'do-able' destination article (the game will automatically begin once one is found) or if you wanna be a hero you can click the <em>'F*@$ it I'll do this one'</em> button and you'll start a game with the articles that are presented at the time of your click. 
</p>

    I wish I could say this is an original idea. I honestly thought of it by myself, but it would seem I'm not the first to create such an app. These guys <a href="http://thewikigame.com/">here</a> have made quite the little business out of it. Nonetheless, I hope you enjoy my little side project!
