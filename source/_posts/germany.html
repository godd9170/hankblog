Way back in Mrs. Affleck's grade twelve calculus class I met this wide-grinned German fellow.

It's rare that you find anyone of any origins other than Prince Edward County at my alma matter PECI. Yet here was Konstantine, who found his was there through his Aunt, and was spending the entire year immersed in rural Canadian culture.
</p>

<p>
He's since visited Canada a number of times, and even participated in a 3 week European trip with myself and some friends back in 2013. Each of his excursions would end with an invitation for us to visit his home in Munich Germany. Well it was time I took him up on that.

I'd booked my flights home from Romania such that I'd allow for 4 days in MÃ¼nchen. There was plenty of sites to be seen, however the first order of business was to enjoy a bottle of quality Deutsch Lager and catch up with my Bavarian Buddy.
</p>

<p>
We took a walking tour of the city and in this case, pictures say much more than I could possibly express.

The trip wouldn't be complete however with a drive on the Autobahn. Part of Kon's weekend plans had us commuting 3 hours north (which would be 4 if we had to travel at Canadian speeds) to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coburg">Coburg</a> where we'd celebrate his friend's 22nd birthday. If traffic is heavy (which it was on our departure) the highway does post a maximum speed of a magnitude relative to the vehicle density. 100km/h was in place, which for the sole Canadian party in the vehicle, seemed entirely reasonable. Then after about a half hour or so of <em>sluggish</em> travel we ramped up to a hefty 180km/h cruising velocity. At first I gripped my passenger assist handle like a louisville slugger, but as we, and those around us continued at this pace, only the speedometer would indicate we were moving at a rate substantially faster than the 119km/h I'm accustomed to.

For the birthday boy's special day we were treated to a traditional bavarian spread. It consisted of cured meats, various egg based spreads, and plenty of whole grain breads to create your own open faced sandwiches. Of course none of this would be complete without ice cold beer served from a wooden keg. A keg tapped by actually hammering a metal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tap_(valve)">spigot</a> into it! Does it get more German than that?

<p>
The theme of the excursion was certainly Beer. As such, this blog post seems to be lacking a few details. The evening following the dinner had us traversing the small town to a party of about 30 or so. Plenty of energy drink infused beverages results in an extremely foggy conclusion to the evening.

A final schnitzel dinner, a 7am boarding and I bid Konsty Auf Wiedersehen.
