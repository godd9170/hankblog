Perspective is a funny thing. How can you properly understand another's viewpoint on something, without having been exposed to the identical series of visions and experiences. I certainly believe that it's healthy to challenge opinions and provide insight from another collection of observational wisdom. However it's up to the brain behind the eyes doing the observing to form an ultimate conclusion. No two sentient minds will ever hold and identical neural database of belief, opinion, knowledge ... and isn't that a wonderful thing. For it's the things that people create based on their perspectives that make this such an interesting world to have a perspective in.
