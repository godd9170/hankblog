    One day, I hope I have an original idea for a blog post. I definitely approach them in full belief that I’m the first to postulate such a thought, yet a quick google shows it’s already a pretty discussed concept. I suppose with 7.4 billion living human brains out there, and millennia of written <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology">Epistemology</a> it would be naive to think you are unique theory. Maybe one day.
</p>

<p>
With that meta thought said, I present to you my iPhone Sunday thought.

      "Feeling that you need to be heard, the ringing voice in your head urging you to talk just for the sake of being heard, is the origins of many useless conversations."

I’m sure you have encountered the type. Chiming in from the other side of the boardroom table on a topic that’s of no familiarity. Offering input that’s of no substance, completely irrelevant and delightfully vague. Not unlike a dodging politician who’s put into the position of providing some narrative to an inquiry that travels 10ft. over their head.
</p>

<p>
The remark will typically be met with silence while the parties scramble to acknowledge and return the conversation back to the substance that was building amongst education contributors.  A <em>polite rejection</em>, to summarize it I suppose. 
</p>

<p>
I’m not sure how I came across it, but one day whilst perusing Wikipedia I learned about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>. Check this out:
</p>

<p>
    <em>The Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias whereby relatively unskilled people suffer from illusory superiority, mistakenly assessing their ability to be much higher than it really is.</em>
</p>

<p>
Bingo! David Dunning and Justin Kruger have just <em>scienced</em> my observations. This iPhone thought is an obvious symptom. I firmly believe that an enormous amount of conference calls I’ve been a part of could be greatly narrowed down if such a condition wasn’t as prevalent. 
</p>

<p>
As if this isn’t already frustrating, the most inhibiting findings lie in the corollary. Those who may very well have an excellent input shy away to those who are simply more confident. So not only are the <em>illusory superior</em> injecting useless material, they're preventing those with productive input from contributing. 
</p>

<p>
So the key takeaway here is to be aware. By definition, if you’re aware you might be the one breathing hot air, you aren’t suffering from the Dunning-Kruger effect. Ask questions when you aren’t certain, and refrain from confidently speculating. It’s good to draw from experience, but make sure it’s relevant to the topic. Finally, if you’re one to control the conversation, make sure you call on those who might be silenced by the confident ineptitude in the room.
