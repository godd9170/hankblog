One of my favourite bars in Bucharest, or anywhere for that matter, is <a href="http://www.oktoberfest-pub.ro/">Oktoberfest</a>. There are a few in town, and some don neon lights twisted such that they spell out 'Non-Stop'. I haven't translated that to pander to you fair english speaking reader - 'Non-Stop' is precisely how it reads. What they are communicating with electronically excited noble gas tubes is that their fine establishment does not close. Should you ever feel the need for a 7am beer on a Sunday Morning, Oktoberfest has your back.
</p>

<p>
The extensive hours of operation however, are not the reason for the metaphorical tip of my hat. Oktoberfest has my recommendation for one particular offering - The Metre. A plank of wood, approximately 1m in length (I'm pretty sure this is the origin of the name) with circular depressions equally spaced along it. Each depression has a notch where the circle becomes tangential with the edge. 8 mugs of beer are then slotted into each depression, with the handle secured in the notch, and served as one big party pack boasting 3.2L of beer.

Have you ever split a pitcher of beer with some acquaintances, in the pursuit of a more economical evening? The contents of which quickly disappears, then without hesitation a server prompts, "Another pitcher?" All parties cease conversation and offer a look consisting of a suggestive eyebrow raise to one another. Finally a leader emerges and confirms the lingering service worker's inquiry with an almost defeated "...yeah sure." All economy has now gone by the wayside and what was supposed to be an in-and-out social beverage has become a regretful Wednesday morning.
</p>

<p>
Well, the same anomaly exists at Oktoberfest tenfold. I once witnessed a table full of 6 Football hooligans demolish upwards of 5 planks. This gave me an idea. My time in Romania was drawing to a close and my colleagues wanted to know how I'd like to conclude my foray. Thus, the metre challenge was born.

Quite simple really, each man must consume a metre. It is a race, and vomiting within 1 hour of consumption will disqualify you.

I came out of the gate pretty hot and consumed my first 0.4L glass well within a minute. A strategy I'd not recommend. I maintained the lead until about pint four where we established a tie. I was slowing my pace whilst my peers increasing. Pint 5 was the hardest, and pint 7 the easiest, and seemed to depend on how much I was thinking about the volume I'd yet to consume. The more I acknowledged the beverage in front of me, the more my stomach loathed the idea of additional lager.

The last beer is where it got interesting. With all three competitors reaching for the final mug synchronously, it was silently established that the men were about to be separately identified from the boys. I knew that chugging would result in an a re-introduction of my stomach contents to the plank, so I took it easy. Iulius was evidently labouring with his ultimate glass, while Costin almost seemed to forget it was a competition. I could see no evidence of struggle in the man's eyes and he effortlessly poured the entirety of #8 to the depths of his stomach. Seeing that rate of consumption nearly caused a gastric eruption of my own. He had done it. Costin was crowned the metre challenge champion, while Iulius violated the only disqualification clause all over some poor soul in the unlit bathroom.
