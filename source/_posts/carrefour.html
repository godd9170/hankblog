While grocery shopping this past week, I stumbled upon a deal that was too good to be true. For the extremely reasonable price of 3.18 Lei, one could take home 2L of 3% Blond Lager. There absolutely had to be a catch. So in the name of science, I conducted an investigation.

As I write this I'm drinking the remainder of the bottle, and have yet to notice a buzz. This might be the catch. I'm confident that putting a few of these less than stellar brown plastics back will eventually yield some intoxication, however therein lies the problem. For just cents more you can get into some much tastier, higher proof brews like Ursus, Ciuc or Timi»ôoara. Maybe there is a moral in here somewhere...
