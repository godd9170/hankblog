"Hey, do you want to go to Italy in two weeks?" "Sure! I'll book a flight." Was the gist of a conversation I had with Sarah about regarding visiting my wayward mother in Sorrento Italy. What seemed almost like a bluff ended up as an impromptu voyage with almost no planning. 

The trip was to be eight days in length. Our flight departed from YYZ on March 9th at 8:10pm EST, and we returned to that very airport a mere eight days later at 4:40pm EST the 17th. "Refreshingly brief" is how I would describe it. I want to be regarded as a more spontaneous individual, and jet setting is certainly one way of accomplishing just that.
