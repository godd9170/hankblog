  One late Saturday evening after a night in rural Holland, I found myself watching a Woodstock Documentary with my new Dutch friend, William. He was a huge fan of all things Woodstock, and had even visited where it took place. He'd taken two separate road trips across continental US and constructed some marvelous scrap books filled with pictures, time relevant billboard charts and various tokens such as receipts and coasters. He knew the owner of the bar we visited (which happened to be hosting a volunteer firefighter party), and was able to teach me how to properly pour a Heineken.

After sampling much of which there is to <em>legally sample</em> in the Netherlands, and feeling that the night was drawing to an end, we gathered around William's living room for a viewing of his favourite documentary - <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066580/?ref_=ttalt_alt_tt">Woodstock</a>.
</p>

<p> I barely remember the narrative that was provided by my well-traveled host, however I do remeber the strong degree of passion with which he spoke of it. I awoke the next day with this in my digital notepad: </p>

That man is in his element. I wish I knew more of why I decided to write that, and I like to think that I meant 'be that guy' in the figurative sense. That guy can seize a moment. I'm guilty of listening to the nagging voice in the back of my head that questions how the particular activity I'm partaking in can be better. 'If only I had ______'. Well <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolfo_de_la_Parra">Adolfo de la Parra</a> doesn't wonder that. Adolfo de la Parra owns every millisecond of that performance, and I want to make that type of mentailty much more common place in my life.
