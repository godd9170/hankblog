I'm currently seeking a place of residence for the next year. I spent the entirety of my childhood in the same home, and the idea of moving used to conjure feelings of anxiety and uncertainty. Four moves in five years later I'm functionally a nomad.

About two years ago I took a hand at writing my own posting in order help my roommate sublet his room for the four months he spent out of town on co-op. To this date it's my most 'liked' Facebook update and in rather egotistical fashion, I thought it would read nicely on my blog. Here it is:

Whatever you do, do not pay Jarrod Keogh his absurdly low rate of $300/month to sublet his room at 43 Hickory Street West for the upcoming winter semester. Trust me, I've been here for 2 years. Yeah fine, sure it can either be furnished or unfurnished, which is extremely convenient, and fine it does boast a full office filing cabinet... But does it have a hot tub? No. He's going to try and tell you that Ryan Gosling once slept in there, (which is only partially true) and that your proximity to the router means unparalleled 100mbps download... But He's half Dutch so take your chances. It will be probably a week or two before your closet stops smelling like Jarrod (which is like wood chips and regular gasoline). Realistically you would get a spot to park your car.. Actually there is room for two if you are in need... Jesus... I just popped my head out there you could probably fit a school bus if you wanted.

Anyways more to my point, your new neighbours will be a real pain. I know that they're 94 and 95 but they only occasionally wave when they're off to what we assume to be medical appointments and funerals of their friends. And forget expecting them to RSVP your event... I've left them off the list of our most recent 1am dub step keg related parties as they haven't even been to one! Instead they have the audacity to sit inside and never contact the authority's with noise complaints when it is completely within their rights to do so. I hope you're also a professional runner! it's a staggering 2 block walk to Laurier (3 technically if your are science building bound) which is not for the faint of heart.

I hope you don't have ADD, because other than the 6TB of movies on our local intranet, our 300gb/mo download cap, cable tv, 6 video game consoles, blue ray library and both beer pong tables it's like god damn solitary confinement up in here.

I trust you'll make the right choice. God forbid this is your last option and you do sign, at least I'll be there. We'll be like John Savage and Robert De Niro in The Deer Hunter. I trust you'll make the right decision.
