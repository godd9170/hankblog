I've nowhere near the sample size to start formulating laws, nor do I think you can just make up a law - however I feel like I'm on to something here. I've now had the (dis)pleasure of working on upwards of 10 different teams in a professional setting for more than a few months. Long enough for the honeymoon effect to end, and for a true assessment of the character of those surrounding me. Invariably some folks transcend a professional relationship, and some folks you tolerate only because you're literally paid to do so. Once you've reached this state, you're able to apply my law.

It's a simple mental evaluation and can only truly be measured by yourself. All you need to do is find some time when you're emotionally neutral (not worked up, or overly happy) and picture in your head someone, and ask yourself the following question. "Would you enjoy dining with them for breakfast?". I'm talking a standard, greasy spoon, no occasion, weekday breakfast. Beginning what is otherwise a day filled with opportunity, a fresh sleep behind you and a world of ambition in your fingertips, with the company of this person and this person only. You don't need to worry about peculiar social implications or optics, pretend this occurred naturally. Do not overthink it, take your first reaction to the thought and use that as the outcome of the assessment.

No changing. This is binary, 'would enjoy/would not enjoy'. This test is horrendously biased and unfair if it were the deciding criteria for a job interview, but that's not the case. I treat this like an exercise in my own personal mental health. Should I ever come to a point where I can't honestly answer 'would enjoy' to a majority of my peers I know it's time to make some moves. I'll never be so naive to think that I can reach 100% on this evaluation, however it's certainly worth striving for.
