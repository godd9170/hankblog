Well I did it. I abstained from consuming alcohol for the most consecutive days in a row since I was in Grade 11 <span style="font-size: 8px;">(Sorry Mom)</span>. I swear I thought of the idea myself, although as I learned while participating that it is very much already a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_January">thing</a>. 
</p>

<p>
Oh well, this wasn't about originality, it was about proving to myself that I could do it. Drinking has become far too regular of an occurrence in my life, and I was curious to see if a lot of the things I blamed on my regular intoxication, were in fact as a result of that. 
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.dryjanuary.org.uk/">DryJanuary.org.uk</a> claims the following 4 benefits from participating.
</p>

<p>
Being an English organization, they've elected to call their fourth benefit <em>'Save loads of <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dosh">dosh</a>!'</em>, which in Canadian means <em>Money</em>. all seem pretty logical, and as of today I can now confirm/deny whether they actually happen.
</p>

<h2 id="Health"><i class="dryjan-health"/> Healthier inside and out</h2>
<p>
    Because I went into this challenge with a clean bill of health, there wasn't really anything I was looking to see improve physically. That being said, I'd noticed that days following long stretches of consumption typically offered a much poorer set of cognitive ability. My memory, my critical thinking and my general problem solving skills were frustratingly inhibited. 
</p>
<p>
    Up until about a week ago, I would have drawn the conclusion that such mental barriers were not as a result of my taste for alcohol. However this final week has changed my perception. I find that I'm able to recall more, quip back with witty material faster and come to a conclusion on the best way to tackle a daily obstacle in a more logical manner. What's more is I find myself to be more calm and tactical in my behaviour.
</p>

<h2 id="Weight"><i class="dryjan-weight"/> Weight Loss</h2>
<p>
    This is the category that unfortunately misses it's mark the most. Just this last weekend (Jan 29th) I was joking about how I'd actually only lost a single pound. It seemed that there was no correlation to weight loss whatsoever, yet this morning atop a mechanical scale at the local gym, I literally stood corrected. It would seem that in the final week I had lost a total of 7 pounds. Which bearing in mind that no other changes had been made to my daily routine, is pretty sweet! 
</p>

<h2 id="Sleep"><i class="dryjan-sleep"/> Improved Sleep</h2>
<p>
    Oh yeah. Dry January is the answer to all my insomniatic cries for help. To be fair I'm exaggerating, I usually sleep decently, however this last month has been what bedtime should always be like. I'm not waking in the middle of the night nearly as much as months previous, nor am I struggling to fall asleep as much. I still find leaving the confines of my mattress difficult in the AM, but throughout the day I'm not catching myself yawning, or thinking of naps. 
</p>

<h2 id="Dosh!"><i class="dryjan-saving"/> Save loads of dosh!</h2>

<p>
    The dosh in my bank account is higher than I anticipated! Thanks to <a href="https://www.mint.com">Mint.com</a> I've got the numbers to illustrate that. Below is my monthly spending on Alcohol and Bars. 
</p>

<p>
    Sure, December brings with it all the time off and excessive consumption, but even still literally an order of magnitude less I spent during dry January. It's actually a bit unsettling how much cash each month gets filtered through your kidneys. 
</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>
    So there you have it. Dry January is a wonderful exercise after all. I'm a sharper, lighter, richer and generally more awake person as a result of it. Granted the key takeaway is that 'dosh' aside, most of the benefits don't manifest themselves until the last week or so. Which begs the question, "Do I continue into February and see if the benefits only increase with time?". I don't know I can't think straight right now, I suppose I'll mull it over this $7.50 Weiss beer.
