Based on every psychological assessment I've done, and through surveying those close to me, I am an extrovert. The last time I went through Myers-Briggs I wasn't just a little extroverted either, I was pushing the maxima. What does that even mean though? If you're one to refer to wikipedia - which don't kid yourself you are - 

>An extraverted person is likely to enjoy time spent with people and find less reward in time spent alone. They tend to be energized when around other people, and they are more prone to boredom when they are by themselves.

That's me alright, if the interaction with 'other people' is one where its socially acceptable to begin speaking to a stranger (Networking event, bar, wedding etc.) or I'm previously acquainted, I am substantially happier than being alone. I think concentrating on social interaction and vocalizing my thoughts just helps me justify my decisions, which in turn allows me to enjoy them more. I seem to need another's understanding of my day to day. Wikipedia goes on to claim that "[extraverts] tend to work well in groups", which I suppose at least in my case is a function of that yearn for peer approval. 

When I first learned about extraversion/introversion it was during grade school, a time where one's social status among peers seemed to mean everything. Those regarded to be objectively superior were the popular. This then justified extraversion as objectively better than introversion. Literally speaking I know that no one side of the spectrum is superior to the other, but I can't shake the negative connotation of 'introvert'. It's because of this association that I truly believe I introduced bias to the Myers-Briggs assessment.

I write this at the midpoint of a solo road trip up the west coast beginning in San Francisco, a trip that I felt I needed as an exercise in mental health. I have no real itinerary other than sleeping on the couches of a few friends along the way and a flight out of Vancouver 2 weeks from my arrival. This means each day I just make up as I go - without that whole affirmation from peers thing I mentioned earlier. So now what is the superior psyche? It would seem this is a situation where introverts reign supreme. 

On day 1 I took to the streets of SF headed right for the Golden Gate bridge. No idea what I would do when I got there, but it at least provided me a direction. As I approached it, I noted that many shops offered a bicycle rental package that let you cycle over the bridge. I declined to enter each of them not wanting to advertise to the shop owners that I was by myself. Somehow I was convinced that it was too socially unacceptable to enjoy only the company of myself. Eventually however I talked myself into braving the pedantic ordeal I'd constructed and unsurprisingly what ensued was no social anguish whatsoever, a few nice conversations, and myself coasting happily across an American landmark. 

My endeavours since have been increasingly less hesitant, I truly feel I'm reaching a new found inner self confidence and a lessened regard for the opinions of those around me. I'm starting to really enjoy my own introspection and look forward to long stretches of road by myself. I suppose this is me truly embracing the side of the spectrum I'd once looked down on.
