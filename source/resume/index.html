                            "Everyone should work in support at least once." - was the advice that I was given by the Account Managers at D2L, and I wholeheartedly agree. It's easy to get too focused on new customers, new features and new markets, but what can make a good company great is how they take care of existing customers.

                            I was responsible for handling admin user tickets that included everything from SQL database maintenance to app pool resets. I'd also aid Technical Account Managers in explaining issues and their corresponding remedies via conference calls.
