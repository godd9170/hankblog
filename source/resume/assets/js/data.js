      "<p>I've become very comfortable working with CSS, and finding myself relying in W3Schools less and less for reminders. I prefer to user SCSS when dealing with larger scale front ends. Webpack has a nice compiler that takes care of the CSS generation as well as slots in browser compatibility attributes.</p>",
      "<p>&#34What&#39s the difference between Java and Javascript? One is a convoluted over contributed, &#39toy&#39  language, and the other is a web scripting language.&#34 HAHA! <span style='font-size: 8px'>(sorry)</span> I used to hate the idea of the &#39callback&#39 soup you&#39d invariably encounter with Javascript, but there has been so much movement, and improvements like ECMAscript that has made me very comfortable with it.</p>",
      "<p>React is my Javascript framework of choice. It makes organizing larger scale Javascript projects extremely modular <span style='font-size: 8px'>(yay for code reuse!)</span> as well as scalable, all while being extremely fast. I&#39ve got a good understanding of the Flux architecture, and an even stronger grasp on component state and the virtual DOM. Check out my <a href='http://wiki.henrygoddard.com'>Wiki-Game</a> side project for an example.</p>",

I quickly grew to admire Mike Bostock, he replied to my <a href='https://twitter.com/mbostock/status/666686236979953664'>tweet</a> once so I guess you could say we&#39re buddies. The timeline on this resume uses D3, and <a href='http://localhost:4000/2015/10/06/baseball/'>this blog post</a> of mine showcases some of it&#39s map charting capabilities.</p>",

I found it to be an effective way to get a solid web server off the ground. While I wouldn&#39t consider myself a <em>Nodey</em>, I do love the community, and the diversity of pluggable modules that exist for it.

Relevant targeted content is king, and Hubspot is the best tool I&#39ve see for indicating what is, and what isn&#39t working. It&#39s also a strong CRM to boot.</p>",
    "<p>I really can&#39t imagine collaborating with other developers without using git. Github is my first stop on any given day of development. I feel very comfortable submitting issues and pull requests, migrating branches and contributing to the strong internal wiki that's offered. I&#39ve even got a good grasp on the more administrative features like the <em>Pulse</em> and team management.</p>",
    "<p>Intercom is a great example of what you get when design is a core value. Becoming proficient in it took no time. I was responsible for integrating it into Beagle, and then in charge of responding to our user&#39 support concerns. I also integrated a number of custom metrics which greatly simplified the support process.</p>",
    "<p>Google Analytics is an absolute no-brainer when trying to better understand your audience. I've worked with it extensively and am extremely comfortable setting it up and digging through the data it collects. In fact, by merely visiting this page, I&#39m collecting data about you using it right now! <span style='font-size: 8px'>(sorry if that&#39s creepy)</span></p>",
